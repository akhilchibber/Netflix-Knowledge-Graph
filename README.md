## Overview
This project creates a comprehensive knowledge graph from Netflix show data using Python, NetworkX, and Cypher queries. The knowledge graph connects various entities such as show titles, genres, directors, actors, and ratings to represent relationships between key attributes in the dataset. By analyzing these relationships, the project demonstrates how graph databases can be utilized for deeper insights into the content available on Netflix. Additionally, the project applies network analysis techniques to assess centrality and importance of nodes, enabling better understanding of content distribution and viewing trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Netflix Knowledge Graph Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).
